# BEAR-Spot-Project
## About
This is our application project for the Spot Robot from Boston Dynamics. 

B.E.A.R. stands for Brentwood Electronic Assistance Robot and we hope to develop a solution that allows for easier package/file delivery at Brentwood High School. This repository includes our open-sourced code for the web application, machine learning image recognition algorithm, and the Spot SDK commands.
